# Daily-Planner

## Project Description
- In this project, I utilized jquery, moment.js, and bootstrap in order to build the webpage. 
- This webpage allows for an individual who works a 9-5 job to organize their day by the hour. 

## How it Works 
- The webpage displays the current date in its header.
- When the user types a task into one of the hourly textareas and clicks "save", the task will appear on the webpage.
- If the user refreshes the browser and/or opens another tab with the same link, then the task will still appear on the webpage.
